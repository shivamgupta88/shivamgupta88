## 🚀 **What I Do**

I build **high-performance backend systems** that scale. As a founding engineer at Reeltor, I've architected microservices handling **20K+ property listings** with **99.9% uptime** and optimized systems to achieve **95% cache hit ratios**.

```javascript
const shivam = {
  code: ["JavaScript", "TypeScript", "Node.js"],
  architecture: ["Microservices", "Event-Driven", "Scalable Systems"],
  databases: ["MongoDB", "Redis", "Replica Sets", "Sharding"],
  performance: "2.5s → 180ms query optimization",
  passion: "Building systems that scale beautifully"
};
```
